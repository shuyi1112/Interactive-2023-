		<br><p style="color: whitesmoke; font-size: 40px;">But there is no hope.</p>
		<br><p style="color: whitesmoke; font-size: 20px;">This is the classroom where I used to go to school, and it was especially cool in the summer when the shade was thick. I liked reading in the shade the most.</p>
		<br><p style="color: whitesmoke; font-size: 10px;">But now, I can't walk out of the shadow anymore ......</p>
